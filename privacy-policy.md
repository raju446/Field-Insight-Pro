Privacy Policy for Salesforce Field Reference Finder

Effective Date: 08/05/2026

Salesforce Field Reference Finder is a Chrome extension with one purpose: to help users find where a selected Salesforce field is referenced in metadata for the currently open Salesforce org.

Data Access

The extension accesses the active Salesforce tab URL only when the user clicks the extension icon from a Salesforce page. This is used to identify the currently selected Salesforce org.

The extension reads the Salesforce session cookie for the selected Salesforce org only to call Salesforce REST and Tooling APIs from the user's browser. These API calls are used to load Salesforce objects, load fields, and find metadata references to the selected Salesforce field.

Data Collection and Storage

The extension does not collect, sell, transfer, or share user data with third parties.

The extension does not transmit Salesforce session cookies, Salesforce metadata, browsing history, or search results to any external server.

All processing occurs locally in the user's browser and through direct calls from the browser to the user's Salesforce org.

The extension may temporarily display debug logs and search results in the extension page. These remain in the user's browser session and are not sent to the developer or any third party.

Permissions

The extension uses Chrome permissions only for its single purpose:

- activeTab: to identify the Salesforce tab from which the user launches the extension.
- cookies: to read the Salesforce session cookie for the selected Salesforce org so Salesforce API calls can be made using the user's existing Salesforce session.
- storage, if enabled: to temporarily remember the selected Salesforce org URL and source tab while opening the extension page.
- Salesforce host permissions: to call Salesforce REST and Tooling APIs for field-reference lookup.

Remote Code

The extension does not use remote code. All JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and assets are packaged inside the extension.
